# SumOf2Numbers-LinkedList
This code accepts 2 numbers, A and B, as linked lists and each digit in the two numbers is represented as a single node. The objective is to return the sum of the 2 numbers as a linked list.

Format :
  Eg 1 : Given the number 123, its linked list representation will be 3->2->1
  
  Eg 2 : Sum of A=123 and B=987 is C=1110
  
   A : 3->2->1                    C : 0->1->1->1
   B : 7->8->9
